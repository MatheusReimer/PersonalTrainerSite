## Welcome to my Node.js - HTML - CSS - Mysql - Website ##

<h3>Initially, this site would just be like a personal marketing for a friend. However, as I would like to improve my knowledge in the backend, I expanded the scope of the project to a website where the personal trainer adds workouts and checks their progress for each student. Students, after adding the information about training can see their progress through a graph for each muscle trained.</h3>
